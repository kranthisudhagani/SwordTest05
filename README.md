# Build Engineer Interview Test
This project is used as the basis for a build pipeline.

You should clone this repo into a public Azure DevOps project and add a build pipeline to demonstrate the following:

- Building the solution
- Executing Unit Tests
- Executing Javascript tests (can be run with the node command `npm test` from the Client App folder)
- Reporting test status as part of the build.

The build should be specified using YAML and stored as a build script within your cloned repository
